## What Is a Regex?

REGEX or regular expressions in coding is a series of characters of letters, symbols, or numbers that specify a search pattern in a given string of text. For example validators are used to find a required pattern to confirm accesssibilty. REGEX are commonly used to create logical conditions. REGEX are used in common programming languages such as JavaScript, Perl, and PHP. Below I will add different parts of the regular expression and what their duty or meaning is in the expression. Also, checkout the link provided to see my first GIST post created. I will deconstruct an example of a regular expression and explain what it is doing in my gist template!

GIST allows you to add code snippets and share with others.
