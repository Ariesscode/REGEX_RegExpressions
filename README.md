# 17 Computer Science for JavaScript: Regex Tutorial (Regular Expressions)


## What Is a Regex?

REGEX or regular expressions in coding is a series of characters of letters, symbols, or numbers that specify a search pattern in a given string of text. For example validators are used to find a required pattern to confirm accesssibilty. REGEX are commonly used to create logical conditions. REGEX are used in common programming languages such as JavaScript, Perl, and PHP. Below I will add different parts of the regular expression and what their duty or meaning is in the expression. 




## User Story

```md
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
```




## Getting Started

Instead of creating a repository, you’ll publish a GitHub gist. GitHub describes a **gist** as a simple way to share code snippets with others. It’s also an ideal way to demonstrate a technique, teach a principle, or show off a solution. It functions just like a repository, and you’ll use Markdown to create it, just as you do with your READMEs. Gists can include code, images, links, and anything else you can include in a README.

After you’ve downloaded the starter code, learn [how to create a gist](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/creating-gists). You can also watch this [video on how to use gists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wc2NlcWjQHw).

> **Important**: Make sure to create a **public** gist and add the `.md` file extension to the file name so that your Markdown renders correctly.

The starter code is a template with a title, introductory paragraph, summary, and table of contents. The table of contents should link to sections of the tutorial that describe the functionality of each component in the regex. Be sure to rename the template to a unique name that describes your tutorial.

> **Note**: The regular expression that you choose might not include all of the components outlined in the starter code. After you’ve finished your walkthrough, you can remove any sections that you didn’t use.

Each section that describes a component should include more than just one sentence explaining what it does. It should also include a code snippet of that particular component and some examples that meet the requirements of that component.

> **Important**: Make revisions to your gist in the GitHub gist UI. This will create a revision history that graders can use to verify that the tutorial content is yours.

## Grading Requirements

> **Note**: If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> * A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> * A repository that only includes starter code

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria:

### Deliverables: 30%

* A valid URL of your GitHub gist.

* Your GitHub gist that contains the tutorial Markdown. Your gist must include the `.md` file extension so that your Markdown renders correctly.

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 50%

* Satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria plus the following:

    * Revisions to the tutorial must be made in the GitHub gist UI so that graders have access to your revision history.

    * The tutorial must cover one of the regex examples listed above or another of your choice. You may NOT use the regex covered in the [Regex Tutorial: Matching a Username](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-science/regex-tutorial).

    * The tutorial must include sections that correspond to each of the components that make up the regex. You may not need to use all of the sections included in the starter code, but you should include all of the sections that correspond to the different components of the regex you chose.

    * Each section that describes a component must include more than just one sentence explaining what it does. It’s okay to use online resources for assistance, but do not copy and paste; explain each component in your own words and be thorough.

    * Each section that describes a component must include a code snippet of that particular component. Use backticks to display your code snippets in Markdown.

    * Each section that describes a component must include at least one example that meets the requirements of that component.

### Tutorial Clarity and Quality: 20%

* Tutorial provides a clear explanation of how the regex works. Be as concise as possible.

* Tutorial describes each regex component in a separate section.

## Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

* The URL of the GitHub gist. Give the gist a unique name.
