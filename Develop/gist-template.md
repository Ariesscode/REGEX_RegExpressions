Validate credit card numbers
## Summary

Credit cards or debit cards are assigned a 16-digit unique identifier, which is stamped in the front of the card. These cards are used all ove the world to make purchases or load funds. Each card has a unique account number and a cardholder name, which is used to prevent fraud or suspicious activities. REGEX is used to validate the 16-digit card numbers by using a few components of REGEX. For example, we can use character classes, quantifiers, and grouping. Visa cards are signified by using a "4" at the beginning of the string and end with a symbol, like this "$". The first number of each visa card is a fixed or constant digit, such as 4, indicating that it is a visa card. Lets take a look at this regular expression for validating credit card numbers: 

("4[0-9]{12}(?:[0-9]{3})?$")
